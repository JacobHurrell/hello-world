# hello-world

Hello fellow worldship passengers!

I'm Jacob, a rapidly budding Data Scientist. I enjoy mining and visualizing data with Python and R, in order to find out what thrilling tales those sneaky spreadsheets are hiding! I also am experienced in database manipulation with SQL and using the sexy program known as Tableau. I am just starting to get my feet wet in the world of Machine Learning, but looking forward to helping bring about the rise of our Robot Overlords... or just increasing my own skill set and available tools... either works for me!
